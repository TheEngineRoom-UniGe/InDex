updating two MPU9250 at the same lane , make some delay problems. 
the readByte function is using endTransmission(false)
which reserves the bus for the first one who called it.
Putting it to false, it make a NACK when trying to check the interrupt status, i.e. reading the 3A address . 
w1.00wa0.00ab0.00bc0.00c
read byte 104 sub :58I2C ERROR CODE : 2  // 104 is the 0x68 
read byte 105 sub :58I2C ERROR CODE : 2  // 58 is the 0x3A , interrupt add.
read byte 105 sub :58I2C ERROR CODE : 2
w1.00wa0.00ab0.00bc0.00c
// adding delays between the two sensors, did not help , same error

Another thing to take care of , is to know that the magnetometer has the 0x0C address, then when putting them on the same bus , we should enable the master mode on one of the two IMUs. 

This is the normal behaviour: 
writeByte(MPU9250_ADDRESS, I2C_MST_CTRL, 0x00); // Disable I2C master // 0x0D for 400 khz clock
writeByte(MPU9250_ADDRESS, USER_CTRL, 0x00);    // Disable FIFO and I2C master modes //  0x20 for master mode
